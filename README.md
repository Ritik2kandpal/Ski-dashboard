# Snowy Analytics: Global Ski Resort Insights Dashboard

## About Project
The Snowy Analytics Dashboard is a data-driven, visually engaging Power BI report that provides insights into over 499 ski resorts across 38 countries and 5 continents. Designed for tourism analysts, travelers, and strategic planners, it highlights slope types, lift infrastructure, seasonal offerings (summer/night skiing), and more to support better decision-making.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
The dashboard was developed using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Main platform for creating visuals and insights

📂 Power Query Editor – For data transformation, cleaning, and shaping

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used to create calculated KPIs and dynamic filters

📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established across tables for cross-filtering and aggregation

📁 File Format – .pbix for development, .png for visual preview, .pbit as a template

## 🔍 Data Source
Primary Sources:

Ski-resort-stats.com

NASA Earth Observations

The dataset includes:

Resort names, countries, and continents

Skiing facilities like night skiing, summer skiing, child-friendliness

Elevation details (lowest and highest points)

Lift types and total number of lifts

Monthly snow cover data for global analysis

## 💼 Features / Highlights
🧩 Business Problem
The global ski tourism industry lacks a unified, visual way to compare ski resorts across continents. Travelers, developers, and tourism bodies struggle to identify resorts based on skill level, seasonal activities, or infrastructure.

## 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard
Provide an intuitive, interactive global dashboard

Enable analysis by continent, country, and resort type

Assist stakeholders in planning, marketing, and expansion

Uncover trends in resort terrain, accessibility, and tourism potential
